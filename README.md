Make backtick wrapped text look like code! {openSource}

An open source extension to make backtick wrapped text look like code in Google Keep.

Any text wrapped in 1 or 3 backticks will be rendered as code (inspired by Markdown syntax).

Use 1 backtick for inline code, and 3 backticks to wrap multi-line code. Note that the 3 backticks MUST be on their own line.

Enjoy!
